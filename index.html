<h1>crypt4gh WebAssembly demo</h1> <br>
<p>This application encrypts data using crypt4gh.</p>
<p>A private key (the sender's key) is randomly generated each time the page is loaded, and a public key (the recipient) is hardcoded.</p>
<p>All work is done in your web browser. Your data never leaves your computer.</p>

<p>Start by giving this application temporary permission to <strong>read and edit</strong> from a directory on your computer.
    This directory should contain the sensitive data that you want to encrypt.
<aside>After you close this tab, the application won't be able to access files on your computer, and you'll need to grant permission again.</aside></p>
<button onclick="openDirectoryPicker()">Select directory</button>
<p>Then encrypt it! This dumb demo <strong>creates an encrypted copy of every file in the directory</strong></p>
<button id="encrypt" disabled="true" onclick="crypt4gh()">Encrypt</button>
